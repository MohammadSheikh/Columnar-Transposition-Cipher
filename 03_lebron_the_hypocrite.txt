"I think when the issue comes up, if you feel passionate about it or you feel like it's something you want to talk about, then so be it. I also don't think every issue should be everybody's problem as well. When things come up, there's multiple things that we haven't talked about that have happened in our own country that we don't bring up. There's things that happen in my own community in trying to help my kids graduate high school and go off to college. That's been my main concern the last couple of years with my school, trying to make sure the inner-city kids who grew up in my hometown have a brighter future and look up to me as an inspiration and get out of the hellhole of inner-city. We don't talk about those stories, we tend to want to talk about so many other things as well. So there's issues all over the world, I think the best thing we can do is, if you feel passionate about it, talk about it, if you are not, if you don't have a lot of knowledge about it, or you don't quite understand it, I don't think you should talk about it, cuz it pushes you in a tough position."
